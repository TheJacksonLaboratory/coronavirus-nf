## Introduction

**nf-core/rnaseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for RNA sequencing data. The workflow processes raw data from
FastQ inputs ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/),
[Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)),
aligns the reads
([STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) or
[HiSAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml)),
generates counts relative to genes
([featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/),
[StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/)) or transcripts
([Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/),
[tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) or
[RSEM](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM)) and performs extensive quality-control on the results
([RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/),
[Qualimap](http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/),
[dupRadar](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dupRadar.html),
[Preseq](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/),
[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html),
[umi_tools](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools),
[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/)).

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

1. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

2. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles). Note: This pipeline does not currently support running with Conda on macOS because the latest version of the `sortmerna` package is not available for this platform.)_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```bash
    nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>
    ```

    > Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    ```bash
    nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --input '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome GRCh37
    ```

See [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/usage) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

### Documentation

The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline which you can read on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq) or find in the [`docs/` directory](docs).
